# Common Web Structures and Layouts

This repository serves as a collection of common web structures and layouts used in modern web development. It includes implementations of basic layouts and interactive components like **carousels**, **layout guides**, and more. The goal is to provide a guide for learning and reusing these structures in your web projects.


## Purpose

I have created this repo for my learning purpose in implementing some new elements or creating new structures/designs in webpages and wanted to have a reference when needed and also sharing it to anyone who needs it.
