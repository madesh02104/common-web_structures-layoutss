# Scrolling  Carousel Effect

This project demonstrates a **Scrolling  Carousel** where a set of images or icons scroll continuously in a seamless loop. It's ideal for displaying technology stacks, sponsor logos, or partner icons on a website.

## How It Works

The carousel creates an infinite scrolling effect by moving a set of logos horizontally across the screen using CSS animations.

### Key CSS Styles Explained

Here are the important styles used to create the scrolling effect:

- **`.logo-slider { overflow: hidden; }`**  
  This hides the logos that are outside the visible area of the carousel, allowing only the logos within the specified width to be shown.

- **`.logo-track { display: flex; animation: scroll 20s linear infinite; }`**  
  The `flex` layout arranges the logos horizontally, and the `animation` moves the track from right to left in a loop over 20 seconds. The `infinite` keyword ensures that the animation keeps repeating.

- **`@keyframes scroll { transform: translateX(-50%); }`**  
  This animation shifts the `.logo-track` container horizontally by `-50%`, creating the scrolling effect. As soon as one set of logos finishes scrolling, the next set starts.

- **`.logo-slider:hover { animation-play-state: paused; }`**  
  The scrolling animation is paused when the user hovers over the logos, allowing them to view the logos more clearly.

### Seamless Scrolling

The continuous scrolling is achieved by duplicating the logos inside the `.logo-track` container:

- **`.logo-slide`**  
  Each `.logo-slide` holds a set of logos. By repeating the same set of logos twice within the `.logo-track`, the carousel creates a seamless loop, ensuring that when one set of logos scrolls out of view, the next set is already in position to scroll in.

By understanding and using these key CSS rules, you can easily replicate the smooth scrolling effect in your own projects. Itâ€™s a flexible and responsive design that works across all devices.
